        As we observe problems associated with the use of environmentally harmful products,
        <br />partly because environmentally friendly products are often more expensive and less prominent,
        <br />we have decided to create a website specifically for eco-friendly products.
        <br />This includes verifying and approving appropriate pricing to make these products more accessible.
        <br />Additionally, we plan to donate a portion of the revenue to environmental projects,
        <br />thus benefiting the environment in two ways and establishing our website as a leading platform for promoting a better environment.
